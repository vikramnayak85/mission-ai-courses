    "---\n",
    "This module will get you familiarised with the concept of variables. We will explore the different types of variables, the operations that we can do on them, as well as some basic built-in Python functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## *1. What is a variable?*\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a `placeholder for a value that we store` in Python. Technically, a variable is a `reserved memory location` to store an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We get data into Python or create data within Python. Where do we store it? *Variables!*\n",
    "\n",
    "> We then manipulate the data, create intermediate results and save the output. How do we use and reference the data and intermediate results? *Variables!*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## *2. Rules for naming variables:*\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid variable names in Python follow these rules:\n",
    "- Start with a letter or the underscore character, not a number. \n",
    "- Only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) \n",
    "- No spaces in the name\n",
    "- Cannot be identical to reserved words in Python like `str`, `print`, etc. If there is a logical name for your variable and it conflicts with a Python reserved keyword, then use a single trailing underscore: `var_`\n",
    "\n",
    "Also remember, variable names in Python are `case-sensitive` ('Size', 'size' and 'SIZE' are three different variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you give `meaningful names to your variables` so that other your code is readable and maintainable.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Examples of invalid variable names\n",
    "9a=6 \n",
    "# (starting with a number)\n",
    "a~5 = 4 \n",
    "# (special character other than _)\n",

    "### Remember, Python is a dynamically-typed, strongly-typed language\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dynamically-typed** means that the type of a variable / object is `not explicitly declared`, but instead it is inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Strongly-typed** means that variables cannot be `coerced to unrelated types, or perform opertions intended for other types`. Strong typing means that once assigned a value of a particular kind, objects obey strict rules about how they can interact with other objects of various types. \n",
    "It is not weakly-typed, as that would mean that the same memory block is being re-interpreted in a different way. Weak-typing means that such rules are more relaxed. This doesn't mean that strongly typed languages are necessarily superior in any way; it's just a language design choice.  1 + \"1\" = error. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Immutability** is a different concept - The contents of the memory locations, at any given point in the program’s execution, is called the program’s state. `When the state of an object cannot be altered after creation, it is immutable`. When you assign some new value to a variable, what actually happens is that the address changes. The contents of the original memory location are not changed. Other than List/Dictionary/Set, all other object types are immutable. So you aren't changing the value as much as creating a new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A variable points to an object with a certain value. Python creates only 1 object with a certain value. It wont allow multiple memory locations to store the same value (say 1000).  If we declare multiple variables with the same value, they are effectively aliases that will have the same id. In effect, all these variables point to the same object in memory. \n",
